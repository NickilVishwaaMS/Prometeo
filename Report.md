## Alzheimer's Disease Progression prediction

### 1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
   - **Download Dataset**: Obtain the OASIS MRI dataset.
   - Before preprocessing, perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics, such as image quality, variability among classes, and any anomalies.
   - **Standardize Images**: Resize and normalize images to a consistent format suitable for both custom and pretrained models.

### 2. Data Augmentation and Dataset Preparation
   - **Augmentation**: Use insights from EDA to guide the data augmentation strategies. For instance, if certain patterns are underrepresented in the dataset, specific augmentation techniques can be employed to address this. Enhance the dataset using transformations like rotations, translations, and flips to introduce variability.
   - **PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader**: Create a custom `Dataset` class and use `DataLoader` for efficient batch processing.

### 3. Custom CNN Architecture
   - **Designing Custom CNN**: Build a CNN from scratch tailored for MRI image analysis. Start with a basic architecture: convolutional layers, activation functions (ReLU), pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
    - **Architecture Informed by EDA**: Design the custom CNN considering insights from EDA, such as the prevalence of certain features in the images.
   - **Intuition Building**: Understand that each convolutional layer helps in extracting features from the images, with deeper layers capturing more complex patterns.

### 4. Implementing Pretrained Models
   - **Utilize Pretrained Networks**: Import models like ResNet, VGGNet, EfficientNet, and MobileNet with pretrained weights.
   - **Model Selection Based on EDA**: Choose pretrained models that are likely to perform well based on the EDA findings. For example, if the dataset contains high-resolution images, models like EfficientNet, which are designed to handle varying scales, might be more appropriate.
   - **Modify for Task**: Adapt these models by altering the final layers to perform classification specific to Alzheimer’s stages.

### 5. Training and Fine-Tuning
   - **Custom CNN Training**: Train the custom CNN from scratch, monitoring its ability to learn features.
   - **Adjust Training Process**: Modify the training process based on EDA findings, such as varying the learning rate if the dataset shows high variance.
   - **Fine-Tuning Pretrained Models**: Unfreeze and train the top layers of pretrained models along with the new classification layers.

### 6. Model Evaluation and Comparison
   - **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate all models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - **Incorporate EDA in Model Evaluation**: Use the insights from EDA to understand and interpret the model evaluation results better.
   - **Model Comparison**: Compare the custom CNN with pretrained models to assess performance differences.

### 7. Understanding Model Behavior
   - **Visualization**: Use techniques like feature map visualization for the custom CNN and Grad-CAM for pretrained models to understand what the models are learning.
   - **Leverage EDA for Interpretation:** Utilize the findings from EDA to aid in interpreting the behavior of both the custom and pretrained models.
   - **Interpreting Results**: Analyze incorrect predictions to gain insights into model behavior and limitations.

### 8. Application Development for Model Deployment
   - **User Interface**: Develop a web application for easy interaction with the models.
   - **Model Integration**: Embed the best performing model, whether it's the custom CNN or one of the pretrained models.

### 9. Reporting and Documentation
   - **Document Findings**: Report on model architectures, training processes, and comparative analysis.
   - **Report Including EDA**: Document the findings from the exploratory data analysis along with the model development process and results.
   - **Maintain Code Documentation**: Ensure clear documentation for replicability and maintenance.

### 10. Deployment and Monitoring
   - **Deploy Application**: Make the application accessible on a server or cloud platform.
   - **Monitor Performance**: Track the application’s performance and user feedback for continuous improvement.
